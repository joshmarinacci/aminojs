 Amino: JavaScript Scenegraph

Amino is a scenegraph for drawing 2D graphics in JavaScript with the
HTML 5 Canvas API. By creating a tree of nodes, you can draw shapes, text, images special effects; complete with transforms and animation.
Amino takes care of all rendering, animation, and event handling
so you can build *rich* interactive graphics with very little code.
Using Amino is much more convenient than writing canvas code by hand.

Here's a quick example:    

    &lt;canvas id="can" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    
    //attach a runner to the canvas
    var can = document.getElementById("can");
    var runner = new Runner().setCanvas(can);
    
    //create a rect and a circle
    var r = new Rect().set(0,0,50,50).setFill("green");
    var c = new Circle().set(100,100,30).setFill("blue");
    
    //add the shapes to a group
    var g = new Group().add(r).add(c);
    
    //make the rectangle go left and right every 5 seconds
    var anim = new Anim(g,"x",0,150,5);
    runner.addAnim(anim);
    
    //set the group as the root of the scenegraph, then start
    runner.root = g;
    runner.start();
    
    &lt;/script&gt;

A note on properties. Most objects have properties like `x` or `width`.
Properties are accessed with getters.  For example, to access the `width`
property on a rectangle, call `rect.getWidth()`. Properties are set 
with setters. For example, to set the `width` property
on a rectangle, call `rect.setWidth(100)`. Most functions, especially 
property setters, are chainable. This means you
can set a bunch of properties at once like this:

    var c = new Rect()
        .setX(50)
        .setY(50)
        .setWidth(100)
        .setHeight(200)
        .setFill("green")
        .setStrokeWidth(5)
        .setStroke("black")
        ;
